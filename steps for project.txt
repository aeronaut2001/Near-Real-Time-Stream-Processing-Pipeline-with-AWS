Sure, here's a step-by-step guide to setting up AWS services for your scenario:

1. AWS CLI Installation:
   - Install the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) on your local machine.
   - Configure the CLI with your IAM user's credentials (access key and secret key).

2. IAM Setup:
   - In IAM, create a new user with programmatic access.
   - Attach policies granting access to DynamoDB (e.g., `AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess`) and Kinesis (e.g., `AmazonKinesisFullAccess`).

3. DynamoDB Table Creation:
   - Use the AWS CLI or AWS Console to create a DynamoDB table.
   - Ensure to enable DynamoDB Streams for the table.

4. Kinesis Data Stream:
   - Create a Kinesis Data Stream.
   - Think of shards as distributed partitions for your data stream.

5. EventBridge Configuration:
   - Set up EventBridge rules to pipe events from a source (e.g., DynamoDB stream) to a target (e.g., Kinesis Data Stream).
   - Ensure the partition key is set appropriately (e.g., eventID).

6. Permissions for EventBridge:
   - Add permissions to the EventBridge service role to access Kinesis and DynamoDB (e.g., `AmazonKinesisFullAccess`, `AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess`).

7. S3 Bucket Creation:
   - Create an S3 bucket to store data from Kinesis Firehose.

8. Kinesis Firehose Delivery Stream:
   - Create a Kinesis Firehose delivery stream.
   - Enable AWS Lambda transformation if data transformation is needed, otherwise, direct the data to S3.

9. CloudWatch Setup:
   - Set up CloudWatch for monitoring and logging.

10. Amazon Athena Configuration:
    - Create a crawler to define the schema for data stored in S3.
    - Create a classifier to handle JSON format data.
    - Define the structure of the JSON data using paths like `$.order_id`, `$.product`, etc.

Ensure that each step is performed accurately and securely. This setup will allow you to process near real-time data from DynamoDB to Kinesis Firehose, with transformation capabilities and efficient data querying using Amazon Athena.
